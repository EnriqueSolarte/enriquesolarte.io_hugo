description: "This project focused on building a semantic map for robot reasoning and scene understanding. In general, the developed system identifies meaningful objects and their features embedding representation aligned with natural language, using VLM and LLM models. This enabled the robot to understand actions through natural language instructions while also interpreting geometric relationships and contextual information. The system was implemented in Python and ROS2 and was evaluated in both Nvidia Isaac Simulation and real-world scenarios."
