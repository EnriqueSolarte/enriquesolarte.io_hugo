title: "Autonomous Vision Inspection System"
duration: "<i>2023</i>"
company: "ITRI - Industrial Technology Research Institute"
description: "This project aimed to develop an autonomous inspection system for a manufacturing process with over 100 production stations. The deployed robot used a classical LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm for localization and a inspection system that incorporated an auto-labeled object detector, a Structure-from-Motion map for each station, and a multi-infrared-camera rig. It achieved a precision of Â±5 mm and a recall of over 98%. The system was implemented in C++, Python, and ROS."
