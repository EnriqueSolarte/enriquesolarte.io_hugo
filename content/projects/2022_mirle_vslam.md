title: "Stereo VSLAM for an AMR"
duration: "<i>2022</i>"
company: "MIRLE Automation Corporation"
description: "This project aimed to validate a stereo vision–based system as an alternative to a LiDAR-based approach for an AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot). It was built from scratch using open-source C++ and Python code. The implemented features include scale recovery, self-calibration, visual odometry, loop closure, and custom sensor fusion with an IMU. When tested on a real robot, the system achieved an error margin within 5 cm and a latency of 20 FPS."
