description: "In this project, I was responsible for the perception module of an autonomous mobile platform patrolling convenience stores. My main task was to develop an object detection system trained on custom products. The system ran on the robotâ€™s onboard hardware at around 20 FPS without a GPU. It was implemented using Python, C++, and ROS. This robot was presented in TAIROS 2018, in Taipei, Taiwan."
