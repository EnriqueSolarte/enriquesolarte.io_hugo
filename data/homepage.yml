    Iâ€™m an Ai and Machine Learning Researcher 
    at ITRI (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx'>Industrial Technology Research Institute</a>) in Hsinchu, Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼.
    With over six years of research and engineering experience, 
    Iâ€™ve worked on various projects in computer vision, image processing, machine learning, and robotics, 
    leading to top-tier publications and successful robot industrial applications.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Originally from Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨, I moved to Taiwan in 2017 to pursue my studies and career.
    I received my M.S. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2019 under the supervision of 
    <a target='_blank' href='https://imt.ntut.edu.tw/p/405-1065-87834,c382.php?Lang=en'>Prof. Syh-Shiuh Yeh</a> 
    at National Taipei University of Technology. 
    My research focused on estimating cutting insert parameters for CNC machines using Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In 2024, I received my Ph.D. degree from National Tsing Hua University under the supervision of
    <a target='_blank' href='https://aliensunmin.github.io/'>Prof. Sun Min</a>, in collaboration with 
    <a target='_blank' href='https://walonchiu.github.io/'>Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu</a> and
    <a target='_blank' href='https://sites.google.com/site/yihsuantsai/'>Dr. Yi-Hsuan Tsai</a>.
    My research focused on geometric perception, particularly self-training solutions using 360Â° cameras and multi-view consistency.    </p> 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In general, my research interests lie in geoemtry perception and robotics. 
    More specifically, I am fascinated by cognitive perception and scene understanding, 
    from the perspectives of neuroscience and robotics.
    Eager to learn, I am always open to new ideas and collaborations!

      You explain something about your academic/study background, as well as your
      preferred areas of work. Think of this area as context-setting for the experience
      that you will describe below. Why did you change jobs? What drove you to take a 
      new gig? Even if you are not looking for a job, it's a good way to hint about
      what kind of projects you are interested in.
