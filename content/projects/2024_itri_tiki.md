description: "This project focused on a vision inspection system to verify the correct positioning of a workpiece before the CMM machine began its inspection. It used an RGB camera and relied solely on image processing for the task, without a deep neural network. The system was implemented in Python and ROS and achieved a precision of Â±0.5 mm and a recall of over 99%. The system was evaluated in a real-world scenario."
