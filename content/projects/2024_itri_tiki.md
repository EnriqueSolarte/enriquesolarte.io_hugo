description: "This project focused on a vision inspection system designed to verify the correct positioning of a workpiece before a CMM machine (Coordinate Measuring Machine) began its inspection. It used an RGB camera and relied solely on image processing, without any deep neural networks. The system was implemented in Python and ROS and achieved a precision of ±0.5 mm and a recall above 99%. It was evaluated in a real-world production scenario."
