title: "Stereo VSLAM for an AVG robot"
duration: "<i>2022</i>"
company: "MIRLE Automation Corporation"
description: "This project aimed to validate a vision-based system as a reliable alternative to a LiDAR-based approach for an AGV robot. It was built upon open-source VSLAM algorithms with modifications, including a scale recovery system, self-calibration, and custom sensor fusion. Tested on a real robot, the system achieved an error margin within 5 cm. It was implemented in C++ and Python."
