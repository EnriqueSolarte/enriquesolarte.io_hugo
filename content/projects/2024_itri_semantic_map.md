title: "Semantic Map for Robot Reasoning"
duration: "<i>2024</i>"
company: "ITRI - Industrial Technology Research Institute"
description: "This research project aimed to build a semantic map representation that enables robot reasoning. The system processes sequences of hand-held images to identify the most meaningful objects in the scene and then estimates feature embeddings aligned with natural language using LVLMs and LLMs. These feature embeddings, when projected into 3D, allow the robot to follow natural-language instructions while also interpreting geometric relationships and contextual information. The system was implemented in Python and ROS2 and evaluated in both NVIDIA Isaac simulation and real-world scenarios."
