title: "AutoLink 2.0: Ai Moderator for 360-images alignment"
duration: "<i>2025</i>"
company: "GoThru360 - Virtual Tours & Google street views"
description: "This project implemented a 360-camera pose estimation method for aligning camera views using dense feature-matching and epipolar geometry constraints. As a result, the camera pose estimation latency was reduced from approximately 30 seconds to under 1 second, with an accuracy of ~5 degrees. The system was successfully integrated into the new Auto-Link 2.0 – Easy Link tool as an upgraded module for GoThru360’s Ai Auto-Moderator."
