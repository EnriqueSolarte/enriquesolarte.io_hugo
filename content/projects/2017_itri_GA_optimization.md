title: "Servo Control Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms and Gradient Descent"
duration: "<i>2017</i>"
company: "ITRI - Industrial Technology Research Institute"
description: "This project aimed to optimize and fine tune the control parameters of a servo control system under unknown external conditions. Due to the high non-linearity of the parameters space, we used a Genetic Algorithm to find the most promising region space, and then used a Gradient Descent algorithm to fine the final model. The project was developed in C# and Matlab."
